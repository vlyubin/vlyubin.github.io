<p>I finally became red on TopCoder!</p>

<p>Apparently not being focused on becoming red and treating TopCoder as a fun way to spend a couple of hours every month helped me a lot - I wasn’t upset about the mistakes that I made anymore, and my performance actually improved (even though I’m not “training”). That was the case with math competitions as well - my two best performances on Putnam were after I spent the previous evening playing videogames.</p>

<p>UPD: Lost my red color after I decided to do some rounds for fun after a year without a practice. <a href="https://www.topcoder.com/members/vlyubin/details/?track=DATA_SCIENCE&amp;subTrack=SRM">My profile</a>.</p>
