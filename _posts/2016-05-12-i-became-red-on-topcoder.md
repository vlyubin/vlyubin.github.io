I finally became red on TopCoder!

*My TC chart*

Apparently not being focused on becoming red and treating TopCoder as a fun way to spend a couple of hours every month helped me a lot - I wasn't upset about the mistakes that I made anymore, and my performance actually improved (even though I'm not "training"). That was the case with math competitions as well - my two best performances on Putnam were after I spent the previous evening playing videogames.

For the reference, here's [Mark Zuckerbergs profile](https://www.topcoder.com/members/mzuckerberg/details/?track=DATA_SCIENCE&subTrack=SRM) and [Adam D'Angelos profile](https://www.topcoder.com/members/dangelo/details/?track=DATA_SCIENCE&subTrack=SRM).

UPD: Lost my red color after I decided to do some rounds for fun after a year without a practice. [My profile](https://www.topcoder.com/members/vlyubin/details/?track=DATA_SCIENCE&subTrack=SRM).
