While I was sick last week and unable to do any productive work, I've decided to take a shot at translation of "Les Misérables" musical into Ukrainian. I went to see it while in London and it was amazing - if you get a chance to go, you should definitely do so.

"Les Mis" has been translated into 16 languages, including Polish and Czech (so good translations to Slavic languages are doable) and it would be really cool if somebody (a professional) could make a Ukrainian production one day.

Translations like these are not straightforward, because music and overall meaning is fixed, although you have a bit more freedom compared to translating poetry. IMHO, translated poetry is often like non-alcoholic beer - looks the same on the outside, but really it's just a fake.

I went for the shortest song, which also has a very clear rythm to it - Javert's song at the end of the "Runaway Cart" scene - [video of this song from 10th anniversary concert](https://youtu.be/Tvan7eQs55c?t=74) - check it out to get a sense of the music used. So without further due, here's my result:

| English | Українська |
|---|---|
| I have only known one other<br>Who can do what you have done<br>He's a convict from the chain gang<br>He's been ten years on the run<br><br>But he couldn't run forever<br>We have found his hideaway<br>And he's just been re-arrested<br>And he comes to court today<br><br>Well, of course he now denies it<br>You'd expect that of a con<br>But he couldn't run forever<br>No, not even Jean Valjean | Досі знав лише одного -<br>Міць атланта у плечAх<br>Є моїм колишнім в'язнем<br>Десять років у бігAх<br><br>Не тікатиме ж він вічно<br>Ми знайшли його притОн<br>Він постане перед судом<br>Перед ним лише закОн<br><br>Звісно він із цим не згідний<br>Хитрий цей хамелеОн<br>Не тікатиме ж він вічно<br>Навіть спритний Жон ВальжОн |


Now, a couple of explanations. First of all, in the 1st line of the 3rd verse the music deviates from the usual rythm, so that line is a bit longer (when measured by number of syllables). I've preserved the repetition of the 1st line of 2nd verse in the last verse, although that wasn't necessary. Lastly, the biggest "loss of content" is the 2nd line of the 1st verse: "Who can do what you have done" vs "Міць атланта у плечAх". "What you have done" refers to Valjean lifting the cart because of his immense power. Prior to this song Javert speaks a short monologue regarding the cart lifting episode, and with that in context my version seems reasonable. So hopefully it's not too bad overall :)

Translating the entire set would be much harder though. For example, Valjeans prison code 24601 is used in a number of places (Prologue, Who am I?) and is quite rythmic in English - "two-four-six-oh-one!". In Ukrainian, that sounds much worse, although the problem is mostly because of 4 - "чотири", which has three syllables. So the simplest solution is to ditch one digit (4) of the prison code and make it 2601 ("два-шість-нуль-один!" sounds OK), but that is a sizeable sacrifice as 24601 is quite [iconic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24,601). Still, even tougher issues will come up when translating complex songs like "I dreamed a dream"... I'm sure that's doable though :)
